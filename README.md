# Pseudocode-Projects
 This repository contains pseudocode solutions to problems proposed in my college 'Analysis of Algorithms' courses.

Solutions include 1) pseudocode to solve the problem (descriptions included when necessary), 2) a justification of correctness, and 3) an analysis of the running time
