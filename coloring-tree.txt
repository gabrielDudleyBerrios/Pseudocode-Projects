PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Given a graph G = (V;E) a k-coloring of G is a labeling of the vertices with the
colors c[1], c[2],..., c[k] such that for every edge (u; v) the color of u is different from
the color of v.
  (a) Give a linear time algorithm that finds a 2-coloring for a tree.
  (b) Think about coloring a tree with two colors so that you have the maximum
      number of nodes colored c1. Prove that your algorithm from part (a), with a
      minor modication probably, can be used to solve this problem. Be precise.
  (c) Show an example of a tree, T, that can have at most j nodes colored c1 in
      a 2-coloring but T can have j0 > j nodes colored c1 in a 3-coloring. Try to
      find the smallest example of such a tree T.
(d) Give a linear time dynamic programming algorithm that creates a 3-coloring
    for a tree such that the maximum number of nodes are colored c1. Justify
    your answer.
